    "This takes standard SIMS Data Extraction files and a creates a distribution of the answers for a selected questions and plots it.\n",

    "## Some Assumptions\n",
    "- You are using an unaltered SIMS data extraction file\n",
    "- The question must be a multiple choice question of some type (Likert, Selection, etc)\n",
    "- You have an `Analysis/Q-Distribution` directory in the folder your are running this Jupyter notebook. This is where the analysis files will go."

    "- Change the variables in the section below. The ones you will need to always change are:\n",
    "    - `file`\n",
    "        - Get the Data Extraction file from SIMS\n",
    "            - This is the Excel file straight from SIMS Data Extraction\n",
    "            - You need to have selected \"Correctness\" for the \"Quiz Reponses\" when you generate the file\n",
    "            - Drag it from your computer and drop it into the file browser in Jupyter (just to the left here)\n",
    "            - Right click on the file and select \"Copy path\" from the data file you want and paste it into the `file` variable below\n",
    "    - `qID1` and `qID2`\n",
    "        - These are the the two columns of data you want to compare. They should be likert scales.\n",
    "        - Make sure there are doulble quotes around the IDs: \"Q23\"\n",
    "        - Don't forget the asteriks if appliccable for retired questions (e.g. \"*Q24\")\n",
    "        - _These need to be on the same scale for this to make sense_\n",
    "    - `likertMax`\n",
    "        - This is the maximum value you can select for this liker (typically 5 or 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have made your changes hit the **SHIFT-RETURN** keys together to run the analysis\n",
    "- Scroll to the bottom to see the results"
