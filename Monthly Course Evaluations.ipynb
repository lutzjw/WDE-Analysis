    "This takes a comma separated data file (generated from the SIMS database using the query below), and creates bar charts comparing a courses standard evaluation questions. Any courses that have responses to the standard evaluation questions for classes in the date range will get a pdf file with the graph, one, one graph per file.\n",

    "## Some Assumptions\n",
    "- You have an `Analysis/Course-Evaluations` directory in the folder your are running this Jupyter notebook. This is where the PDF files containing the graphs will go.\n",
    "- You have a datafile generated from the SIMS database using the query below in \"__Query to pull data__\""

    "- Change the variables in the section below. The ones you will need to always change are:\n",
    "    - `file`\n",
    "        - This is the comma separated data file that is generated from the query above. It is individual answers to the standard course evaluation questions, one answer per line. Typically we can just collect the data for the previous month and append it to this data file.\n",
    "    - `startDate` and `endDate`\n",
    "        - This is the start and end dates for the classes you want to generate the charts for. Somebody may complete an evaluation well after the class has occured, so there may be some anomylous data over time.\n",
    "    - `directoryName`\n",
    "        - This is the name of the directory that will be created in `Analysis/Course-Evaluations`. This is where all of the PDFs of the graphs wil go. The directory will be created if needed. Any existing files will be overwritten if the same file names are generated.\n",
    "    - `thisCourseOnly` (optional)\n",
    "        - This specifies that you should create graphs for ONLY this course. The name must match __EXACTLY__. Set this variable to double quotes if you want all courses in the time range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have made your changes hit the **SHIFT-RETURN** keys together to run the analysis\n",
    "- Scroll to the bottom to see the results\n",
