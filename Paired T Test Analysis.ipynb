    "# WISER SIMS Data Extraction Paired T-Test Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes standard SIMS Data Extraction files and runs a paired T-Test on pre and post quizzes. \n",
    "- Author  : John Lutz <lutzjw@upmc.edu>\n",
    "- Created : 2020-02-18\n",
    "- Edited : 2020-02-20\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Assumptions\n",
    "- You are using an unaltered SIMS data extraction file\n",
    "- This is a Paired T-Test, so each student needs to have just 2 tests, one pre test and one post test. \n",
    "    - If a student has more than two tests (e.g. June 1 Pre-test, June 7 Pre-test, and June 14 Post-test), the program will take the **last** test of the type (In our example it would take the June 7 Pre-test and June 14 Post-test)\n",
    "- Any 0 or -999 in an answer is taken as incorrect, including multiple choice, so an answer of \"1,1,0,1\" is considered incorrect\n",
    "- You have an `Analysis/T-Analysis` directory in the folder where you're running this Jupyter notebook. This is where the analysis files will go."
